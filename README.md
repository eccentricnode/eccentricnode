# Austin Johnson

I am learning backend programming using a weird mix of JavaScript and Python. 

I love tinkering with Linux, and I am rocking a Pop_OS as my daily driver. 

I follow https://boot.dev courses.

I am great at building UIs and can get started in Frontend project pretty quickly.

### I have experience with:
 - Angular
 - Vue.js
 - Nuxt.js
 - .NET Core/C#
 - Ktor/Kotlin
